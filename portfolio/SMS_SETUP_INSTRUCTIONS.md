# SMS Setup Instructions for Portfolio Contact Form

## âœ… Current Status
The contact form is fully functional and will log messages to the console. To receive SMS messages on your phone (7096179673), follow these steps:

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Twilio Account
1. Go to [https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your phone number (7096179673)

### Step 2: Get Your Credentials
After signing up, you'll see your dashboard with:
- **Account SID** (starts with "AC...")
- **Auth Token** (click the eye icon to reveal)

### Step 3: Get a Phone Number
1. In your Twilio Console, go to "Phone Numbers" â†’ "Manage" â†’ "Buy a number"
2. Search for an Indian number (+91) or use a US number (free tier)
3. Buy the number (free with trial credits)

### Step 4: Configure Your Portfolio
Replace the placeholder environment variables with your real Twilio credentials:

```bash
# Your Twilio Account SID (starts with AC)
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Your Twilio Auth Token  
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here

# Your Twilio phone number (the one you purchased)
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890
```

### Step 5: Update Environment Variables
Use the DevServerControl tool to set these variables, then restart the server.

## ðŸŽ‰ How It Works

1. **Someone fills out your contact form**
2. **Clicks "Send Message"**
3. **You instantly receive an SMS** on 7096179673 with:
   - Their name
   - Their email
   - Their message

## ðŸ”„ Current Fallback
Until you set up Twilio, messages are logged to the server console, so you can still see them in the development logs.

## ðŸ’¡ Benefits
- **Instant notifications** - Know immediately when someone contacts you
- **No email checking** - Get notified directly on your phone
- **Professional** - Shows you're tech-savvy and responsive
- **Free tier** - Twilio gives you free credits to start

## ðŸŒŸ Alternative Options
If you prefer not to use Twilio, the form can also be configured to:
- Send emails instead
- Save to a database
- Send to webhooks (Discord, Slack, etc.)

Your contact form is ready to impress HR managers! ðŸš€
